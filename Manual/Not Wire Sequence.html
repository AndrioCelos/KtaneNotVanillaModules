					<h2>On the Subject of Not Wire Sequences</h2>
					<p class="flavour-text">
						It's hard to say how this manual works. The writing is somewhat
						clear, but there must have been an easier way to manage twelve wires.
					</p>

					<p style='color: black;'>
						<span class='first'>The</span> colour of each wire represents a paragraph
						within this manual, and each number on the right
						corresponds to the word at that position into the
						paragraph, indexing from <span class='last'>zero</span>.
					</p>
					<p style='color: red;'>
						<span class='first'>There</span> will always be three wires on each panel. For each pair of letter
						and number connected by a wire, index that many words into the
						paragraph indicated by the colour of the wire, and if the word located
						contains the letter connected to the wire, cut it. Otherwise, leave it
						alone. Repeat the procedure mentioned for all twelve <span class='last'>wires</span>.
					</p>
					<p style='color: blue;'>
						<span class='first'>After</span> all wires necessary have been cut, press the down button to move
						on to the next panel. The module will be disarmed after all four panels
						have had their required wires cut. Cutting an incorrect wire will
						register a <span class='last'>strike</span>.
					</p>
					<p style='color: #aa0;'>
						<span class='first'>The</span> first word of each paragraph will be bolded, and the last word of
						each paragraph will be underlined. This is to ensure that the
						boundaries between each body of text are very clearly <span class='last'>established</span>.
					</p>
					<p style='color: #0a0;'>
						<span class='first'>When</span> locating a word from a paragraph, starts from the first word at
						zero, and count along until you have reached the desired number. If the
						number given is larger than the amount of words in the paragraph, move
						back to the first word of the paragraph after you have reached the <span class='last'>end</span>.
